.TH PCP-BUDDYINFO 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"

.SH NAME
\fBpcp-buddyinfo\fP \- Report statistics for buddy algorithm shown in cat /proc/buddyinfo

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpcp\fP [\fBpcp options\fP] \fBbuddyinfo\fP [\fB-s\fP \fBsamples\fP] [\fB-a\fP \fBarchive\fP] [\fB-Z\fP \fB--timezone\fP] [\fB-z\fP \fB--hostzone\fP] [\fB-V\fP \fBVersion\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBpcp-buddyinfo\fP command is used for viewing different stats related to buddyinfo. It helps users analyze useful information related to the buddy algorithm. The information includes the total number of zones that are currently active, order pages etc. By default, \fBpcp-buddyinfo\fP reports live data for the local host.

The statistics shown are as follows:

HEADER          DESCRIPTION
_               _
Normal          zones available
Nodes           available nodes
Order0          available pages of order 0
Order1          available pages of order 1
Order2          available pages of order 2
Order3          available pages of order 3
Order4          available pages of order 4
Order5          available pages of order 5
Order6          available pages of order 6
Order7          available pages of order 7
Order8          available pages of order 8
Order9          available pages of order 9
Order10         available pages of order 10
.TE


Each column represents the number of pages of a certain order (a certain size) that are available at any given time. For example, for zone DMA (direct memory access), there are 90 of 2^(0*PAGE_SIZE) chunks of memory. Similarly, there are 6 of 2^(1*PAGE_SIZE) chunks, and 2 of 2^(2*PAGE_SIZE) chunks of memory available.

The DMA row references the first 16 MB on a system, the HighMem row references all memory greater than 4 GB on a system, and the Normal row references all memory in between.

.SH NOTES
\fBpcp-buddyinfo\fP collects information from \fI/proc/buddyinfo\fP and aims to be command-line and output compatible with it.

.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fP are used to parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each installation, the file \fI/etc/pcp.conf\fP contains the local values for these variables. The \fB$PCP_CONF\fP variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration file, as described in \fBpcp.conf\fP(5).

For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see \fBpmGetOptions\fP(3).
