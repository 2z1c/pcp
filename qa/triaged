# Tests that might fail, but where further investigation is not warranted,
# e.g. known bug, fix is difficult and pending, or sometimes timing issues
# on particular platforms.
#
# Fields are
# - <seqno>
# - <whatami-RE>
# - <comments>
#
# If test <seqno> fails, but there is an entry in this file for that
# <seqno> and the <whatami-RE> field (a grep(1) regular expression)
# matches the output from admin/whatami, then the test is considered
# "Triaged" not "Failed".
#
# The fields here are <tab> separated to allow a space in the
# second field in particular.
#
# Because the <whatami-RE> field is used with egrep, one needs to
# (backslash) escape both [ and ( ... (none of the other special egrep
# RE characters appear in the whatami output).
